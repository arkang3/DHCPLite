DHCP Lite library for Arduino v0.04

This library implements rudimentary DHCP and DNS processing for Arduino.

The library has been tested on Arduino Uno/Duemilanove. It correctly
handles requests from clients running Windows Vista, Ubuntu 11.04,
and iOS 4 running on iPod. See LIMITATIONS and KNOWN BUGS.

HISTORY

I have been looking for DHCP server library for Arduino and while
there are several libraries mentioned in Arduino forums (most notably
http://www.musically.me.uk/DHCP_Web_Server_12.pde,
http://www.aether-hemera.com/blog/default.asp?PostId=30, and
Nebster's DHCP server code from this forum thread
http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1239258729), 
some used UDP libraries I could not use and some I simply could not 
get to work.

I wrote this library in a way that should be easy to integrate with
other network libraries as it only takes a buffer (that is expected 
to have a DHCP message or DNS message) and compiles a response using 
the same buffer.

INSTALLATION

Copy the content of examples/ and libraries/ to your 
Arduino folders: arduino/examples/ and arduino/libraries/.

THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

The library has no external dependencies.

The example is using RedFly library that comes with RedFly shield
(both are available at http://www.watterott.net/projects/redfly-shield).

LIMITATIONS

Only DHCP REQUEST and DHCP DISCOVER messages are being handled.
All DHCP INFORM messages get DHCP NAK in response.
Only 12 leases are tracked by default.

KNOWN BUGS

The library does not work for clients running iOS 2 on iPhone and 
Snow Leopard v10.6.8 on MacBook Pro. The library responds with a
DHCP DISCOVER message, but it doesn't seem to be recognized by the client
and the DHCP REQUEST message never follows.

Windows Vista (and possibly other versions of Windows) seems to rely on 
DNS Suffix Search List rather than Connection-specific DNS suffix in 
generating fully qualified hostnames (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/275553).
This means that even though you can set your domain name to "mydomain.net"
and the DHCP server will report this using option 15, when you try to
resolve "arduino", it will send a request for "arduino.mshome.net",
rather than "arduino.mydomain.net" (which will fail to resolve).

If you know how to fix this, send me an email.
