DHCP Lite library for Arduino v0.01

Visit http://notebook.kulchenko.com/dhcplite for updates.

The library has been tested on Arduino Uno/Duemilanove. It correctly
assigns IP addresses to clients running Windows Vista, Ubuntu 11.04,
and iOS 4 running on iPod. See LIMITATIONS and KNOWN BUGS.

HISTORY

I have been looking for DHCP server library for Arduino and while
there are several libraries mentioned in Arduino forums (most notably
http://www.musically.me.uk/DHCP_Web_Server_12.pde,
http://www.aether-hemera.com/blog/default.asp?PostId=30, and
Nebster's DHCP server code from this forum thread
http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1239258729), 
some used UDP libraries I could not use and some I simply could not 
get to work.

I wrote this library in a way that should be easy to integrate with
other libraries as it only takes a buffer (that is expected to have a DHCP
message and compiles a response in the same buffer).

INSTALLATION

Copy the content of examples/ and libraries/ to your 
Arduino folders: arduino/examples/ and arduino/libraries/.

THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

The library has no external dependencies.

The example is using RedFly library that comes with RedFly shield
(both are available at www.watterott.net/projects/redfly-shield).

LIMITATIONS

Only DHCP REQUEST and DHCP DISCOVER messages are being handled.
All DHCP INFORM messages get DHCP NAK in response.
Only 12 leases are tracked by default.

KNOWN BUGS

The library does not work for clients running iOS 2 on iPhone and 
Snow Leopard v10.6.8 on MacBook Pro. The library responds with a
DHCP DISCOVER message, but it doesn't seem to be recognized by the client
and the DHCP REQUEST message never follows.

If you know how to fix this, send me an email.
